To install and run the code you've provided, which includes a web user interface with Streamlit, a summarization function using Langchain, and translation also via Langchain, you will need to follow several steps. Here is the automated installation documentation:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later.
- pip (Python package manager).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Git Repository or Download the Source Code**  
   If the code is hosted on a Git repository, use the following command to clone it. Otherwise, download and extract the source code into a directory of your choice.
   ```bash
   git clone [GIT_REPOSITORY_URL]
   cd [DIRECTORY_NAME]
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (optional, but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary packages using pip. Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file is present in the folder.
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain python-dotenv html2text
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add any necessary API keys and other configurations required by the code.

5. **Run the Streamlit App**
   Launch the application using Streamlit.
   ```bash
   streamlit run [FILE_NAME].py
   ```

### Usage
- Open your browser and go to the address indicated by Streamlit (usually `localhost:8501`).
- Use the GUI to enter the URL you wish to summarize and translate.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary API keys for Langchain and OpenAI services.
- If you encounter dependency issues, check the versions of the packages in `requirements.txt`.

This installation documentation is intended to be executed in a Unix-like environment (Linux/MacOS). For Windows, some commands may slightly vary.
